#Team-3-voyagers
t3v members portfolio page

A custom grid framework was from https://github.com/mumani/CSS-Framework/blob/master/classes.css was used in designing the page layout. It's in the classes file in CSS-Grid Folder.

The two main section were replicated from the following websites
    'The Team' section from  https://wearecrunch.dk/about/?lang=en
    'Members'  section from  https://www.elegantthemes.com/layouts/food-drink/food-recipes-team-page/live-demo


The social icons used were from https://www.microverse.org Everything else was built using HTML5 forms and CSS3.
The font families were imported from https://fonts.google.com in the framework classes.
The images used were modelled and featured members of Microverse's Team-3-voyagers group then hosted on Google Drive.
